Chatflow APP Backend

- Read code instructions from .clinerules folder
- A fastAPI backend for a ai chat applications
- Flutter devises only Linux and Android
- App needs to handle authentication with email and password
- App should have endpoints that receive a conversation and the output would be autogenerated with AI
- response should be in stream mode
- responses can have more than just text (audio, images, text, forms, actions) start simple but structure the code so we can include more options in the future
- the backend should be able to call mcps if the AI decides to.
- we will start with single human-AI conversation, but we will extend to multi-human - multi ai conversation so structure the code accordingly
